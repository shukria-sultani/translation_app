üöÄ Quick Start (Local Development)
Prerequisites
You must have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/shukria-sultani/translation_app.git
cd translation-app

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Configure the OpenAI API Key üîë (Crucial Step)
The application requires your secret API key to communicate with OpenAI.
Create a file named .env in the root directory of your project.
Add your API key to the file using the variable name your application expects (usually prefixed with VITE in standard Vite projects):


# Replace 'sk-...' with your actual key
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note: The .env file must be listed in your .gitignore to prevent committing your secret key to the repository.

4. Run the Application

npm run dev
The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is occupied).
